        <p>Sarcoidosis is a multisystem chronic granulomatous disease with lung involvement in more than 90% cases. High diversity in clinical progression and disease outcome makes it challenging to define well characterized phenotypes. 
			</p>
		  <p>
We conducted both supervised and unsupervised analysis on the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) transcriptomic profiles from a cohort of sarcoidosis patients (n=219) grouped in 8 clinical phenotypes:  stage I, stage II-III treated, stage II-III untreated, stage IV treated, stage IV untreated, acute sarcoidosis, remitting and multiorgan. RNA was isolated from BAL cells and sequenced by Ion Torrent Proton. Non-parametric correlation test and the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were used to identify gene modules associated with each clinical trait and severity of disease. Validation was performed using a microarray expression dataset of an independent Sarcoidosis cohort (Freiburg, Germany (n=50)).
			  </p>
		  <p>
Supervised analysis using 209 BAL samples identified relatively low number of genes with limited significance associated with clinical phenotypes (stage I, II-III and IV, acute, remitting and multiorgan), severity of disease and treatment (FC&lt;-2 or &gt;2; p&lt;0.05). However, when demographics, Scadding, PFTs, CT imaging features and cell differentials were analyzed as continuous variables, numerous pathways implicated in cell cycle, immune response, and lipid metabolism were identified. The unsupervised analysis of entire cohort revealed 5 new distinguished gene modules significantly associated with multiple clinical traits and BAL cell differentials. Cluster analysis of these gene modules identified novel groups of subjects to have: 1) hilar lymphadenopathy and acute lymphocytic inflammation, 2) extraocular organ involvement and PI3K activation, 3) chronic and remitting disease and 4) multiorgan disease with increased immune response. These 4 novel endotypes were successfully validated for association of gene expression with cell differentials and PFTs using Freiburg cohort (chi-square p value&lt;0.05).  
			  </p>
		  <p>
Our approach allowed identification of novel subject’s groupings suggestive of distinct sarcoidosis molecular and clinical endotypes.

		  <p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>
<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>
<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>
<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>
<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>
<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.</p>
